# Resize Photos - Challenge

### Language and Testing

The chosen language was Python because it is a simple and practical language, allowing you to create an application that runs on a server with Flask within minutes.

Unit tests were implemented using the unittest library.

### How to run the code?

Before running the code, you need to install some libraries with the commands below.
```
pip install Pillow
pip install requests
pip install pymongo
pip install flask
```
With the libraries installed, simply run the following command to run the code.
```
python app.py
```
This command will start the server on port 5000. Open the browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to see the application running.
